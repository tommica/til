# Rewrite user to remote file if not in local

This skips the theme files, as it could damage them - those you need to check manually

```bash
find . -path ./wp-content/themes -prune -o -name '*.php' -exec sed -i '1 s/^<?php.*$/<?php/g' {} \;
```

Also, look for these strings for more possibly infected files:
	- "eval("
	- "eval ("
	- "crc32"
	- "base64_decode"
	- "SOL_SOCKET"
